   <h1>The Peregrine Programming Language</h1>
</p>
NOTE:-It has been discontinued. Please use mojo

Peregrine is a Compiled, Systems Programming Language, currently under development.


## Purpose and intent


### Why am I creating this language?

I am creating it to have the simplicity of Python with the efficiency of C.

### Goals

- Ease of use
- Fast
- Highly modular
- Occupies less memory
- Compiled


### How does it work?

You can consider it to be a dialect of python which compiles to clean C++. It will have no garbage collector because it is a system programming language.


## Building/compiling Peregrine


### Requirements to build from source

- [clang compiler](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

# Compilation instructions

**1) Clone the main branch of https://github.com/peregrine-lang/Peregrine.git**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peregrine-lang/Peregrine.git
```
**2) Cd into the directory**
```bash
cd Peregrine
```
**3) Build it**
```bash
meson builddir
cd builddir
ninja
```
This will create the binary of the compiler named ``./peregrine.elf`` in the builddir folder

**C++ backend**
To compile it using the c++ backing just run ``./peregrine.elf compile path_to_file.pe`` .It will create the executable named ``./path_to_file``. Run it to see the result. Check the [can_comp.pe](https://github.com/peregrine-lang/Peregrine/blob/main/can_comp.pe) file in the root directory to know what you can do with the c++ backend at this point

**JS Backend**
To use the javascript backend use the following command
``./peregrine.elf compile path_to_file.js.pe -js``.
It will create the javascript file named ``path_to_file.js``. Run the generated javascript using ``node path_to_file.js``. Check the [can_comp.js.pe](https://github.com/peregrine-lang/Peregrine/blob/main/can_comp.js.pe) file in the root directory to know what you can do with the js backend at this point


## Progress

Currently we are working on the codegen and some Peregrine programs are working


## Example

Here is a small example for you to understand:

```py
def fib(n:int) -> int :
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

def main():
    count:int = 0
    res:int = 0

    while count < 40:
        res = fib(count)
        count++

```

The `main` function is the entry point for the program.
